# Just act natural Autoclicker exploit
This exploit was found in December 11 2022<br/>
Last documentation update was in December 12 2022<br/>
The exploit is still unpatched
<br/>

## How to perform it?<br/>
It relies on super fast clicking when you are a seeker (with infinite ammo)<br/>
This effect can be also be achieved using autoclicker
<br/>

## How it works?<br/>
The answer is very simple, when seeker shoots it generates a laser-like effect that when it's multiplied causes lag

## Effects of the exploit
(The exploit was tested in private lobby with 2 players)<br/>
I did the exploit and my fps dropped from 120 to 12<br/>
My friend's fps dropped from 60-50 to 7-10<br/>
<br/>
I know that it can cause more damage on weaker devices and certainly on smartphones

## Solution
This is very simple but still dangerous exploit so that's the reason why it must be patched quickly<br/>
Here are some ideas how to fix:<br/>
Add a little cooldown between shooting<br/>
Remove infinite ammo<br/>
Add a detector that will disable shooting when the cps is too high<br/>
